/**
 * Regression test for a real bug found in PR review:
 * `MempoolReputationChecks.checkMultipleRolesViolation`
 * (packages/executor/src/services/MempoolService/reputation.ts) used to
 * reject a self-relay sender's own SECOND pending transaction.
 *
 * Self Relay is the shape where `payer === sender` (the transaction pays
 * for itself - see `FrameTxMempoolEntry`'s class doc comment; `helpers.ts`'s
 * `buildUnsignedFrameTx` always builds this shape). The violation check's
 * job is to catch one entity acting as a plain "sender" in one mempool
 * entry while ALSO acting as a "payer" for a DIFFERENT entity's entry - a
 * reputation-gaming vector. It didn't exclude the case where `payer` and
 * `sender` are the SAME entry's own fields: a self-relay sender's first
 * pending transaction put that sender's address into both `accounts`
 * (as a sender) and `otherEntities` (as that entry's own payer), so the
 * sender's own second transaction collided with itself and was rejected.
 *
 * ## Why this goes through `debug_bundler_setMempool`, not `eth_sendFrameTransaction`
 *
 * The obvious way to write this test - sign nonce N and nonce N+1 from the
 * same sender and submit both via `eth_sendFrameTransaction` - does not
 * work against this shared e2e devnet, and it's not a Skandha bug: ethrex
 * simulates every submission against CURRENT LATEST STATE, with no
 * pending-nonce queue concept (see `frameTxSync.e2e.test.ts`'s own comment
 * on the same constraint). This devnet never mines a block at all
 * (`ethrex-devnet.sh` deliberately runs without `--dev` - see its own
 * comment on the Hegota/`engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4` incompatibility), so
 * an account's on-chain nonce never advances past genesis; a real second
 * transaction at nonce N+1 is rejected by ethrex itself
 * ("Nonce mismatch: expected N, got N+1") before Skandha's own mempool
 * logic - the thing actually under test here - is ever reached.
 *
 * `debug_bundler_setMempool` is the right tool instead: it calls
 * `MempoolService.addFrameTx` directly, for each transaction in order,
 * WITHOUT going through ethrex simulation at all ("persist to the local
 * mempool without simulation" - `Debug.setMempool`'s own comment). Two
 * self-relay transactions from the same sender, submitted together, drive
 * `checkMultipleRolesViolation` through the exact real sequence that
 * used to fail: the second `addFrameTx` call sees the first entry (same
 * sender) already in the mempool. This is still a real, unmocked
 * Skandha process and a real RPC call - it just sidesteps a devnet
 * limitation that has nothing to do with the bug being tested.
 *
 * ## Running it
 *
 *   ./test/e2e/ethrex-devnet.sh build   # once; slow
 *   bun run build                       # Skandha's lib/ output is what runs
 *   npx vitest run test/e2e/frameTxSelfRelayMultiTx.e2e.test.ts
 *
 * The devnet itself is started and stopped by this test.
