# Devnet Explorer UI Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build `packages/devnet-ui`, a static web explorer that shows, for a selected Skandha EIP-8141 instance, its mempool, every admission (including rejections, rule by rule), the lifecycle of a transaction, its peers, and which of the user's other instances have a given transaction and when they first saw it.

**Architecture:** A Vite + React single-page app that talks straight to each node's read-only `skandha_explorer_*` JSON-RPC methods and its `explorerEvents` WebSocket stream. Every response is validated with zod against schemas that are compile-time-checked against the backend's wire types. Only the selected instance holds a WebSocket; a resumable stream client (`sinceSeq`, `bootId` restart check, history-gap check, backoff) feeds React Query invalidation. A fake explorer node with the real protocol behavior serves as the development backend and the browser-test target.

**Tech Stack:** Bun 1.2, Vite 8, React 19, TypeScript 5.9, TanStack Query 5 and Router 1 (code-based routes), Tailwind CSS 4 with hand-built components, zod 4, Vitest 5 (jsdom) and Playwright 1.63.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-devnet-explorer-design.md`, "UI design (sub-project 2)". The backend contract this plan consumes is `docs/skandha_explorer.md` and `packages/types/src/explorer/index.ts` (branch `feat/devnet-explorer-backend`, PR forshtat/framepool#3).

## How this plan was produced

Every file below was written and verified first in a scratch project: **152 unit tests and 11 Playwright tests pass**, both type-check projects are clean, and the production build works. The tasks are cut so that each one, built from only the files created up to that point, type-checks and passes its cumulative test count on its own (8, 19, 33, 50, 72, 92, 105, 117, 122, 152 after Tasks 1 to 10). The code blocks in this plan are those verified files, verbatim. An implementer who changes them has to justify it with a failing test; "I would have written it differently" is not a reason.

## Branch and prerequisites

- Work on branch `feat/devnet-explorer-ui`, stacked on `feat/devnet-explorer-backend`, because the app imports the explorer wire types from `@skandha/types/lib/explorer/index.js`, which exist only on that branch. When PR #3 merges into `develop`, rebase this branch onto `develop`.
- In a fresh worktree run `bun install` at the repo root, then build the packages the executor's tests need: `types`, `db`, `utils`, `params`, `monitoring` (each `cd packages/<name> && bun run build`). Task 1 does this.
- All commands below are run from the worktree root unless a step says `cd packages/devnet-ui`.
- Commit messages end with these two lines:

## Global Constraints

Copied from the spec, with the two amendments Task 1 records in the spec:

- Location: leaf workspace package `packages/devnet-ui`. Not a git submodule. It is not part of the root `build` chain.
- Stack: Vite, React 19, TypeScript, Bun, TanStack Query and Router, Tailwind v4. **Amended:** components are hand-built (no shadcn/ui), and there is no viem until the transaction builder needs it. zod does runtime response validation.
- One shared UI with an editable list of instance URLs; the main screen shows the selected instance. The list and selection persist in `localStorage`; no other global state library.
- Data comes only from the read-only `skandha_explorer_*` methods. The UI never calls `debug_bundler_*`.
- Only the selected instance holds a WebSocket. Other instances are queried over HTTP on demand.
- React Query keys start with the instance URL (`["x", url, ...]`) so one prefix invalidates or resets everything held for a node.
- The UI checks `protocolVersion` and shows a compatibility banner on mismatch. Responses are validated at runtime; unknown object keys are dropped and unknown rule ids, lifecycle kinds and statuses are tolerated.
- Routing: `/`, `/activity`, `/peers`, `/tx/:hash?node=<url>`. A link whose `node` is not in the list offers to add it.
- Error states, each with plain-language copy: instance unreachable (with a CORS hint), method not found (start the node with `--explorer.enable`), protocol mismatch, socket dropped (reconnect and resume from `sinceSeq`; a changed `bootId` or evicted history reloads and says so).
- Wire numbers are plain JSON numbers; nonce and fees are `0x` hex strings.
- The only `@skandha/types` import is the zero-import subpath `@skandha/types/lib/explorer/index.js`.
- Version pins are exact and were verified together. Do not "upgrade while you are there".
- Other packages' tests must keep passing after this package is installed (Task 1 checks it).

## Design direction

The subject is a mempool inspector for protocol engineers and devnet testers; its job is to answer "why was my transaction accepted or rejected, what is in the pool, what happened to it, and who has it". A frame transaction is an ordered strip of frames checked by rules, so the UI draws exactly that.

- **The memorable element is the frame strip** (`FrameStrip`): each frame is a block whose style says what it is (solid = verify, outlined = sender, dashed outline = default), with the verdict of every rule that checked it drawn beneath. Everything else stays quiet.
- **Color:** a cool "fog" ground (`#e9eef1`) with a petrol ink (`#12232e`), and one accent (`#2b49c4`). The saturated hues are only the verdicts (`pass #0b7a63`, `fail #c2263f`, `warn #8f5400`), so a failed rule is the loudest thing on any screen. A dark theme follows `prefers-color-scheme`. Verdicts are never color alone: a ringed tick (passed), a diamond cross (failed) and a dashed ring (not evaluated) differ in shape and always carry text.
- **Type:** Bricolage Grotesque for headings, Instrument Sans for text, Spline Sans Mono only for hashes, addresses and rule ids. All self-hosted through Fontsource, so the page needs no third-party request. Sentence case throughout; no all-caps labels.
- **Layout:** a persistent instance list on the left, the selected instance's views on the right, left-aligned, rules and whitespace instead of cards. Tables scroll inside their own container so the page never scrolls sideways at phone width.
- **Motion:** only where it answers an event: a row that just changed gets a fading wash and a static marker (the marker alone under `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- **Copy:** plain verbs; errors say what happened and what to try; empty screens say what to do.

## Review Focus

Failure modes the spec implies that a happy path would not exercise. Each is pinned by a test in the task named.

1. **A node that answers with things this version does not know:** unknown rule ids, lifecycle kinds or statuses, extra fields, a `null` entry, checks with no frame index. The page must render, not crash. (Tasks 1, 5, 8, 9, 10)
2. **A stream that misbehaves:** duplicate or out-of-order events, a drop mid-stream, a node restart, evicted history, an explorer that is off, switching instance while reconnecting, unmounting. No lost or doubled event, no leaked timer or socket. (Tasks 3, 7, 11)
3. **Hostile or broken input and storage:** blocked or corrupt `localStorage`, duplicate or malformed instance URLs written differently, junk typed into the hash search. (Tasks 4, 10)
4. **Users who cannot rely on color or a mouse:** verdicts differ by shape and text, focus is visible, motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, everything is reachable by keyboard. (Tasks 8, 10, 11)
5. **Long unbroken text:** a huge failure detail or revert reason must wrap inside its container, and no page may scroll sideways at 375 px. (Task 11)

## Not in this plan

- Serving the built app from the Skandha API server under `/ui` (the spec allows it; any static host works today). Deploying it to the public devnet is the next piece of work.
- The frame-transaction builder.
- Persisted history, charts, authentication.
- A collapsible instance list on phones (the list stacks above the content; noted as a follow-up).
- A dedicated accessibility audit tool (axe); the tests here pin the specific behaviors above.

### Task 1: Package scaffold and protocol schemas

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.tools.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `src/setupTests.ts`
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/protocol/schemas.ts`, `src/protocol/compat.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/protocol/protocol.test.ts`
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-devnet-explorer-design.md` (stack row); `bun.lock` (generated by `bun install`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `ExplorerInfoSchema`, `AdmissionRecordSchema`, `LifecycleEventSchema`, `TransactionSummarySchema`, `TransactionDetailSchema`, `PeerSchema`, `TransactionPageSchema`, `AdmissionPageSchema`, `PeerListSchema`, `SerializedFrameTxSchema`, the inferred types `Info`, `Admission`, `Check`, `LifecycleEventData`, `TransactionSummary`, `TransactionDetail`, `Peer`, `SerializedFrameTx`, `protocolGuards`; `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `checkProtocol(info): Compat`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Prepare the worktree and confirm a green baseline**

From the worktree root:

```bash
bun install
(cd packages/types && bun run build)
(cd packages/db && bun run build)
(cd packages/utils && bun run build)
(cd packages/params && bun run build)
(cd packages/monitoring && bun run build)
(cd packages/executor && bunx vitest run test/services test/modules test/config.test.ts)
```

Expected: the executor run ends with `Test Files  22 passed (22)` and `Tests  212 passed (212)`. If it does not, stop: the baseline is not green and nothing below can be judged.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the package configuration**

Create these files. The versions are exact and were verified together. Two pitfalls found while verifying, both handled by what is written here: do **not** add `@testing-library/jest-dom` (it hoists to the repo root and binds to the root's older `vitest`, so its matchers break), and import `describe`/`it`/`expect` from `"vitest"` explicitly in every test (never rely on globals), so they always resolve to this package's own Vitest.

    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2023", "DOM"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",

**`packages/devnet-ui/vite.config.ts`**

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  test: {
    environment: "jsdom",
    setupFiles: ["./src/setupTests.ts"],
    include: ["src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}", "mock/**/*.test.ts"],
    css: false,
  },
});
```

**`packages/devnet-ui/.gitignore`**

```
dist

shots
```

**`packages/devnet-ui/src/setupTests.ts`**

```ts
import { afterEach } from "vitest";
import { cleanup } from "@testing-library/react";

// jsdom does not implement scrollTo; the router calls it on navigation.
window.scrollTo = () => {};

afterEach(() => {
  cleanup();
});
```


`tsconfig.json` lists `mock/state.ts` and `mock/fixtures.ts` in `include` before they exist; that is fine (an `include` entry that matches nothing is ignored) and keeps the file unchanged for the rest of the plan.

- [ ] **Step 3: Install and check the new package did not disturb the others**

```bash
bun install
grep -m1 '"version"' node_modules/vitest/package.json
grep -m1 '"version"' packages/devnet-ui/node_modules/vitest/package.json
grep -m1 '"version"' packages/devnet-ui/node_modules/typescript/package.json
(cd packages/executor && bunx vitest run test/services test/modules test/config.test.ts)
```

Expected: the root `vitest` is still `0.34.6`; the package's own are `5.0.1` and `5.9.3`; the executor run again ends with `22 passed` files and `212 passed` tests. If the executor run changes, stop and report it: the workspace install is not safe as specified.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the failing tests**

    expect(SerializedFrameTxSchema.safeParse({ ...tx, frames: [{ mode: "verify" }] }).success).toBe(

- [ ] **Step 5: Run them and watch them fail**

```bash

Expected: FAIL. The test file cannot load because `./schemas` and `./compat` do not exist (`Failed to load url ./schemas`).

**`packages/devnet-ui/src/protocol/compat.ts`**

```ts
import { EXPLORER_PROTOCOL_VERSION } from "@skandha/types/lib/explorer/index.js";

/** The explorer protocol version this app understands. */
export const SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION = EXPLORER_PROTOCOL_VERSION;

export type Compat =

export function checkProtocol(info: { protocolVersion: number }): Compat {

        ok: false,
        nodeVersion: info.protocolVersion,
        supported: SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
      };
}
```


- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests and the type-check**

```bash
cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx vitest run src/protocol && bunx tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: `Tests  8 passed (8)`; `tsc` prints nothing.

- [ ] **Step 8: Record the stack amendment in the spec**

In `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-devnet-explorer-design.md`, replace the row

```
| Stack | Vite, React 19, TypeScript, Bun, TanStack Query and Router, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, viem. |
```

with

```
| Stack | Vite, React 19, TypeScript, Bun, TanStack Query and Router, Tailwind v4, zod. Components are hand-built (no component library); viem is added when the builder needs it. |
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/devnet-ui bun.lock docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-devnet-explorer-design.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(devnet-ui): package scaffold and validated explorer protocol schemas

)"
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Prove the compile-time guard bites**

The guard at the bottom of `schemas.ts` is worthless if it can never fail. Add a required field to `ExplorerInfoSchema` with your editor (a line `bogusFutureField: z.string(),` right after `bootId: z.string(),`), then:

```bash
cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx tsc --noEmit; echo "exit: $?"
```

Expected: `error TS2322: Type 'true' is not assignable to type 'false'` and a non-zero exit. Restore the file and confirm nothing changed:

```bash
git checkout -- packages/devnet-ui/src/protocol/schemas.ts
cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx tsc --noEmit; echo "exit: $?"
git status --short
```

Expected: `exit: 0` and no output from `git status`.

### Task 2: JSON-RPC client and error kinds

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/rpc/errors.ts`, `src/rpc/client.ts`, `src/rpc/methods.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/rpc/rpc.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the schemas from Task 1.
- Produces: `rpcCall(url, method, params, schema, opts)`; error classes `UnreachableError`, `ExplorerDisabledError`, `ProtocolError`, `RpcMethodError`, `HttpStatusError`; `describeError(err, url): ErrorNotice`; `explorerApi.{info, listTransactions, listAdmissions, getTransaction, peers}`.

The Skandha API answers a failed call with HTTP 200 and `{ error: { message, data, code } }`, and an unexpected crash with a 5xx and `{ error: "<string>" }`; the client handles both, plus proxy error pages that are not JSON.

### Task 3: Resumable event stream

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/rpc/stream.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/rpc/stream.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `LifecycleEventSchema`, `Info` (Task 1).
- Produces: `ExplorerStream` (`start()`, `stop()`), `StreamCallbacks` (`onEvent`, `onStatus`, `onReset`, `onFatal`), `StreamDeps` (`createSocket`, `fetchInfo`, `setTimer`, `clearTimer`), `SocketLike`, `StreamStatus`, `ResetReason`.

On every (re)connect the stream reads `info` first. A different `bootId` means the node restarted (its `seq` restarted too); `lastSeq + 1 < oldestSeq` means the node evicted events this client never saw. Either way the caller is told to reload and the stream resumes from the node's current `latestSeq`. Otherwise it resumes from the last delivered `seq`. Sockets and timers are injected so every branch is testable.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

EOF
)"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove the gap test bites**

Change `this.lastSeq + 1 < info.oldestSeq` to `<=` in `src/rpc/stream.ts` with your editor and run `cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx vitest run src/rpc/stream.test.ts`.

Expected: exactly one failure, `does not reset for a resume point right at the oldest retained event` (`expected [ 'gap' ] to deeply equal []`). Restore it and confirm nothing changed:

```bash
git checkout -- packages/devnet-ui/src/rpc/stream.ts
cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx vitest run src/rpc/stream.test.ts
git status --short
```

Expected: the run is green again (`Tests  14 passed (14)`) and `git status` prints nothing.

### Task 4: Instance list store

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/instances/store.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/instances/store.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Instance`, `InstancesState`, `InstancesAction`, `instancesReducer`, `normalizeUrl`, `validateNewInstance`, `wsUrl`, `loadState`, `saveState`, `fallbackState`, `defaultInstances`, `STORAGE_KEY`.

A bare origin becomes `<origin>/rpc` (where Skandha serves JSON-RPC); a URL is the instance's identity, so the same node written two ways is a duplicate; storage that is missing, blocked, corrupt or invalid falls back to the defaults.

### Task 5: Formatting, frame decoding and rule grouping

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/logic/format.ts`, `src/logic/frames.ts`, `src/logic/rules.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/logic/logic.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Check`, `SerializedFrameTxSchema` (Task 1); `GLOBAL_RULE_ORDER`, `ENTITY_RULE_ORDER`, `EXPLORER_RULES` from `@skandha/types/lib/explorer/index.js`.
- Produces: `shortHash`, `shortAddress`, `hexToBigInt`, `formatQuantity`, `formatGwei`, `formatClock`, `formatAgo`, `formatDelta`, `describeSource`, `formatBytes`; `scopeOf`, `modeName`, `frameRole`, `parseFrameTx`, `entitiesByFrame`, `describeFrames`, `FrameView`, `Entity`; `ruleInfo`, `groupChecks`, `failureSummary`, `GroupedChecks`, `EntityGroup`.

The node does not promise the order of `checks[]`, so `groupChecks` sorts by the protocol's rule-order arrays and never trusts array order.

### Task 6: Mock explorer node

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/mock/state.ts`, `mock/fixtures.ts`, `mock/ports.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/mock/state.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the schemas (Task 1).
- Produces: `MockNode` (`handle(method, params)`, `subscribe(sinceSeq, send)`, `admit`, `reject`, `setStatus`, `replace`, `restart`, `explorerEnabled`, `bootId`), `passingChecks`, `serializeTx`, `STATUSES`; fixtures `TX`, `makeTx(t0)`, `T0`, `PEERS`, `primaryNode`, `secondaryNode`, `disabledNode`, `liveTx`, `hashOf`, `addrOf`; `MOCK_PORTS`.

The mock is a pure state machine that answers the five `skandha_explorer_*` methods exactly like the backend: the same error codes (`-32601` explorer off, `-32600` bad request), the same cursor rules (offset for the pool, `id` for admissions), the same page-size clamp (default 50, max 200) and the same status-to-event mapping (`OnChain` is `included`, `Cancelled` is `dropped`, everything else is `statusChanged`). Its tests validate every response with the UI's own schemas, so the mock cannot drift from the contract. The fixtures cover every state the UI must render: an included transaction, a sponsored 3-frame one, a fresh one, two different rejections (several violations at once; a failure at the prefix stage), a whitelist waiver, a revert, a replacement, and a factory deploy. `makeTx(t0)` lets the dev server place the data just before "now", while tests use the fixed `T0`.

### Task 7: Data layer

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/data/keys.ts`, `src/data/liveFeed.ts`, `src/data/live.tsx`, `src/data/hooks.ts`, `src/instances/context.tsx`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/data/live.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `explorerApi` and error kinds (Task 2), `ExplorerStream` (Task 3), the instance store (Task 4).
- Produces: `keys`; `LiveFeed`; `LiveProvider`, `useLive`, `useFresh`, `StreamFactoryContext`, `createBrowserStream`, `StreamFactory`; hooks `useInfo`, `usePool`, `useActivity`, `usePeers`, `useTransaction`, `useAcrossInstances`, `fetchTransaction`, `useNow`; `InstancesProvider`, `useInstances`.

`LiveProvider` owns the selected instance's stream. Events refresh that instance's queries (batched over 250 ms); reaching "live" refreshes everything; a restart or history gap resets everything and shows a notice; switching instance stops the old stream; renaming an instance does not restart it. Queries poll only while the stream is not live. A transaction the node has never heard of resolves to `null` (an answer), so the UI can tell "not there" from "could not ask".

### Task 8: Design foundation and the frame strip

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/index.css`, `src/ui/VerdictMark.tsx`, `src/ui/StatusBadge.tsx`, `src/ui/CopyText.tsx`, `src/ui/Banner.tsx`, `src/ui/FrameStrip.tsx`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/ui/primitives.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Check` (Task 1), `modeName` and `ruleInfo` (Task 5).
- Produces: `VerdictMark`, `verdictLabel`, `Verdict`; `StatusBadge`; `CopyText`; `Banner`; `FrameStrip`, `frameVerdict`, `framesFromChecks`, `framesOfCount`, `StripFrame`; the design tokens in `index.css`.

`CopyText` must never claim a copy that did not happen: with no clipboard it does nothing (a check the tests pin; the first version of this code got it wrong). Note for tests that use `userEvent.setup()`: it installs its own clipboard stub, so stub `navigator.clipboard` after calling it.

### Task 9: Transaction page parts

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/ui/tx/RuleChecklist.tsx`, `src/ui/tx/FramesTable.tsx`, `src/ui/tx/Timeline.tsx`, `src/ui/tx/AcrossInstances.tsx`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/ui/tx/RuleChecklist.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `groupChecks`, `failureSummary`, `ruleInfo` (Task 5); `VerdictMark`, `StatusBadge` (Task 8); `useAcrossInstances` (Task 7).
- Produces: `RuleChecklist({ checks })`, `FramesTable({ frames })`, `Timeline({ events })`, `AcrossInstances({ instances, hash, current })`.

The checklist shows transaction-level rules first, then each validation frame's rules, then rules that never ran. A frame whose rules all passed folds away (`<details>`, closed); a frame with a failure stays open, so failure stays the loudest thing on the page. `AcrossInstances` asks every listed instance about the transaction and lines up who saw it and how much later.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

**`packages/devnet-ui/src/ui/tx/RuleChecklist.test.tsx`**

```tsx
import { render, screen, within } from "@testing-library/react";
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

  ["trace-alignment", "out-of-gas", "OP-011"].map((rule) => ({
    rule,
    frameIndex,
    entity,
    verdict: rule === failRule ? "fail" : "pass",
    ...(rule === failRule ? { detail: `${entity} broke ${rule}` } : {}),
  }));

describe("RuleChecklist", () => {
  it("folds a frame whose rules all passed and keeps a frame with a failure open", () => {
    const checks: Check[] = [

      ...frameChecks(0, "sender"),
      ...frameChecks(1, "payer", "OP-011"),
    ];
    const { container } = render(<RuleChecklist checks={checks} />);
    const groups = container.querySelectorAll("details");
    expect(groups).toHaveLength(2);
    expect(groups[0]?.open).toBe(false);
    expect(groups[1]?.open).toBe(true);
    expect(screen.getByText("3 of 3 passed")).toBeTruthy();
    expect(screen.getByText("1 failed, 2 passed")).toBeTruthy();
    expect(screen.getByText("Turned away: Banned opcodes (payer, frame 1).")).toBeTruthy();
    expect(screen.getByText("payer broke OP-011")).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it("says every rule passed for a clean report", () => {
    render(<RuleChecklist checks={[{ rule: "prefix", verdict: "pass" }]} />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Every rule passed.")).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it("says some rules were not evaluated when nothing failed but something was skipped", () => {
    render(
      <RuleChecklist
        checks={[
          { rule: "prefix", verdict: "pass" },
          { rule: "mempool", verdict: "skipped" },
        ]}
      />,
    );
    expect(screen.getByText("Some rules were not evaluated.")).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it("lists unevaluated frame rules apart, with the reason", () => {
    render(
      <RuleChecklist
        checks={[
          { rule: "prefix", verdict: "fail", detail: "not recognized" },
          { rule: "OP-011", verdict: "skipped" },
          { rule: "storage", verdict: "skipped" },
        ]}
      />,
    );
    const section = screen.getByRole("heading", { name: "Frame rules not evaluated" }).parentElement!;
    expect(within(section).getByText(/an earlier failure stopped them/)).toBeTruthy();
    expect(within(section).getByText("Banned opcodes")).toBeTruthy();
    expect(within(section).getByText("Storage access")).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it("gives each rule a tooltip explaining what it checks", () => {
    render(<RuleChecklist checks={[{ rule: "OP-011", verdict: "pass" }]} />);
    expect(screen.getByTitle(/opcodes validation forbids/)).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Task 10: Shell, screens and the app

This is the largest task (eleven source files and the 30 app-level tests) because the router's registered types tie the screens and the app together; it cannot be split without leaving a stage that does not compile. Review it file by file.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/app.tsx`, `src/testUtils.tsx`
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/ui/shell/InstanceRail.tsx`, `SearchBox.tsx`, `LiveChip.tsx`, `NodeGate.tsx`
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/src/ui/screens/PoolScreen.tsx`, `ActivityScreen.tsx`, `PeersScreen.tsx`, `TxScreen.tsx`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/src/app.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything from Tasks 1 to 9, and `mock/fixtures.ts` (test data).
- Produces: `App`, `createAppRouter`; `renderApp`, `installMockFetch`, `idleStream` (test helpers).

The app tests wire the real UI to the mock node through a stubbed `fetch`, so each test exercises a screen down through the protocol and the schemas, with no hand-made responses. Test-writing notes learned while verifying: the router renders asynchronously, so tests must `await screen.findBy...` before the first query; a failure's text legitimately appears twice (in the report and in the timeline), so scope such queries to a section with `within(...)`; the instance's "select" button and its "Rename"/"Remove" buttons all contain the name, so match the select button with `/^Name/`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test helpers and the failing tests**

**`packages/devnet-ui/src/testUtils.tsx`**

```tsx

import type { StreamFactory } from "./data/live";
import type { Instance } from "./instances/store";
import type { MockNode } from "../mock/state";

/** A stream that never connects, so tests stay in control of live events. */
export const idleStream: StreamFactory = () => ({ start() {}, stop() {} });

/**
 * Routes `fetch` to in-memory mock nodes by URL, answering the way the real API
 * does. A URL with no node behaves like an unreachable host.
 */
export function installMockFetch(nodes: Record<string, MockNode>): void {
  vi.stubGlobal(
    "fetch",
    vi.fn(async (input: unknown, init?: RequestInit) => {
      const url = String(input);
      const node = nodes[url];
      if (!node) throw new TypeError("Failed to fetch");
      const body = JSON.parse(String(init?.body)) as { id: number; method: string; params: unknown[] };
      const outcome = node.handle(body.method, body.params);
      const payload =
        "error" in outcome
          ? { jsonrpc: "2.0", id: body.id, error: outcome.error }
          : { jsonrpc: "2.0", id: body.id, result: outcome.result };
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(payload), { status: 200, headers: { "content-type": "application/json" } });
    }),
  );
}

export interface RenderAppOptions {
  path?: string;
  instances: Instance[];
  selectedUrl?: string;
  createStream?: StreamFactory;
}

/** Renders the whole app on a memory router with a fixed instance list. */
export function renderApp({ path = "/", instances, selectedUrl, createStream = idleStream }: RenderAppOptions) {
  const router = createAppRouter(createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [path] }));
  const queryClient = new QueryClient({ defaultOptions: { queries: { retry: false, staleTime: 0 } } });
  const view = render(
    <App
      router={router}
      queryClient={queryClient}
      initialInstances={{ instances, selectedUrl: selectedUrl ?? instances[0]?.url ?? null }}

```


- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests, the type-check and the build**

```bash
cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx vitest run && bunx tsc --noEmit && bunx vite build
```

Expected: `Test Files  10 passed (10)`, `Tests  152 passed (152)` with no warnings in the output; `tsc` prints nothing; `vite build` ends with `✓ built` and writes `dist/` (about 480 kB of JavaScript, 145 kB gzipped, plus self-hosted font files). `dist/` is git-ignored.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/devnet-ui/index.html packages/devnet-ui/src
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task 11: Mock server and browser tests

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/mock/server.ts`, `mock/dev.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`
- Test: `packages/devnet-ui/e2e/explorer.spec.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `MockNode` and fixtures (Task 6), the app (Task 10).
- Produces: `startMockServer(makeNode, port)`; `bun run mock` (three nodes on ports 14401 busy, 14402 peer, 14403 explorer off); test controls `POST /__mock/{admit,status,restart,disconnect,reset}`.

`server.ts` serves a `MockNode` the way a Skandha instance does: JSON-RPC over HTTP at `/rpc` with CORS open and an `RpcError` as HTTP 200 with `error.code`, and the `explorerEvents` stream over WebSocket at the same path, registering and replaying on the next tick after the subscribe response (as the real node does). A WebSocket error carries a `message` and no `code`, matching the real node. `dev.ts` places the fixtures just before "now" so pages read as recent.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the server, the dev entry and the Playwright config**

**`packages/devnet-ui/mock/server.ts`**

```ts
import type { ServerWebSocket } from "bun";
import { liveTx } from "./fixtures";

  unsubscribe: (() => void) | null;
}

export interface MockServer {
  port: number;
  node: () => MockNode;
  stop(): void;
}

const CORS = {
  "access-control-allow-origin": "*",
  "access-control-allow-headers": "content-type",
  "access-control-allow-methods": "POST, GET, OPTIONS",
};

function json(body: unknown, status = 200): Response {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(body), {
    status,
    headers: { ...CORS, "content-type": "application/json" },
  });
}

function randomId(): string {
  return `0x${Math.floor(Math.random() * 2 ** 48).toString(16).padStart(12, "0")}`;
}

/**
 * Serves a `MockNode` the way a Skandha instance does: JSON-RPC over HTTP at
 * `/rpc` (CORS open, RpcError as HTTP 200 with `error.code`) and the
 * `explorerEvents` stream over WebSocket at the same path. `/__mock/*` are

curl -s localhost:14403/rpc -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"skandha_explorer_info","params":[]}'
kill %1
```

Expected: `typecheck` prints nothing; the first `curl` returns a `result` with `"protocolVersion":1` and `"bootId":"0a1b2c3d4e5f6071"`; the second returns `"error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Explorer is disabled: start the node with --explorer.enable"}`.

});
```


- [ ] **Step 4: Run them**

```bash
cd packages/devnet-ui && bunx playwright test
```

Expected: `11 passed`. The config starts the mock nodes and a Vite dev server itself. It drives the Chrome installed on the machine (`channel: "chrome"`) because Playwright 1.63 cannot install its own Chromium on macOS 13 (`bunx playwright install chromium` fails there). In CI, run `bunx playwright install chromium` and set `PW_CHANNEL=chromium`. If a test fails, `test-results/` holds a trace (`bunx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Look at it**

Start `bun run mock` and, in another terminal, `VITE_EXPLORER_INSTANCES='[{"name":"Devnet miner","url":"http://localhost:14401/rpc"},{"name":"Local peer","url":"http://localhost:14402/rpc"},{"name":"No explorer","url":"http://localhost:14403/rpc"}]' bun run dev`, open http://localhost:5173 and check by eye, in light and dark and at phone width: the pool, the activity list, a rejected transaction (`/activity`, then click the one with a red frame), and the sponsored 3-frame transaction. Expected: the frame strip reads as designed (solid blocks for verify frames, an outlined block for the user operation, verdict marks beneath), a failed rule is the loudest thing on its page, and nothing scrolls sideways on a phone. Report anything that looks wrong; do not restyle on taste alone.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/devnet-ui/mock/server.ts packages/devnet-ui/mock/dev.ts packages/devnet-ui/playwright.config.ts packages/devnet-ui/e2e
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task 12: Package README and repo docs

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/devnet-ui/README.md`
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md` (two small additions)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the README**

**`packages/devnet-ui/README.md`**

````markdown
# @skandha/devnet-ui

A web explorer for Skandha EIP-8141 instances. Point it at one or more nodes started with
`--explorer.enable` and it shows, for the selected node:

- **Pool**: what is in the mempool now, updating live.
- **Activity**: every admission, including what the node turned away, with the failing rule.
- **Transaction**: the frames, the rule-by-rule admission report, what happened to the transaction,
  and which of your other instances have it and when they first saw it.
- **Peers**: the node's p2p peers.

It is a static single-page app. It talks to each node directly over JSON-RPC and WebSocket
(`skandha_explorer_*`, see [`docs/skandha_explorer.md`](../../docs/skandha_explorer.md)), so a node
must allow this page's origin (`--api.cors`, default `*`).

## Run it

```sh
bun install                      # from the repo root
cd packages/types && bun run build && cd ../devnet-ui   # the app imports the explorer wire types

bun run mock                     # three fake nodes on :14401 (busy), :14402 (peer), :14403 (explorer off)
VITE_EXPLORER_INSTANCES='[{"name":"Devnet miner","url":"http://localhost:14401/rpc"},{"name":"Local peer","url":"http://localhost:14402/rpc"},{"name":"No explorer","url":"http://localhost:14403/rpc"}]' \
  bun run dev                    # http://localhost:5173
```

Against a real node, skip the mock and set `VITE_EXPLORER_INSTANCES` to its URL, or add it from the
**Add instance** form. Without `VITE_EXPLORER_INSTANCES` the first visit lists `http://localhost:14337/rpc`.
The list is remembered in the browser.

## Test it

```sh
bun run typecheck                # app and tooling projects
bun run test                     # Vitest: protocol, RPC, stream, logic, mock node, components, app
bun run test:e2e                 # Playwright against the mock nodes and a Vite dev server
```

`test:e2e` drives the Chrome installed on your machine (`channel: "chrome"`), because Playwright
cannot install its own Chromium on some older macOS versions. In CI, run
`bunx playwright install chromium` and set `PW_CHANNEL=chromium`.

## Build and host it

```sh
bun run build                    # type-checks, then writes dist/
```

`dist/` is plain static files: serve it from any static host. Set `VITE_EXPLORER_INSTANCES` at build
time to preset the instance list. A page served over https can only call https nodes (browsers block
mixed content), so put nodes behind TLS or serve the page over http.

## How it is put together

| Folder | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/protocol` | zod schemas for every explorer response, a compile-time guard against the backend's wire types, and the protocol-version check |
| `src/rpc` | the JSON-RPC client and its error kinds, and `ExplorerStream`: the resumable WebSocket follower (`sinceSeq`, `bootId` restart check, history-gap check, backoff) |
| `src/instances` | the instance list: a pure reducer, URL normalization, and tolerant persistence |
| `src/data` | React Query keys and hooks, the live feed for row highlights, and the provider that owns the selected node's stream |
| `src/logic` | pure formatting, frame decoding and rule grouping |
| `src/ui` | the primitives (`FrameStrip`, `VerdictMark`, ...), the shell and the screens |
| `mock/` | a fake explorer node with the real protocol behavior, and a thin Bun server around it (`bun run mock`) |
| `e2e/` | Playwright tests |

Design in one paragraph: a frame transaction is an ordered strip of frames checked by rules, so the
UI draws exactly that. Each frame is a block whose style says what it is (solid: verify, outlined:
sender, dashed: default) and the verdict of each rule that checked it sits beneath. Verdicts differ in
shape as well as color (ringed tick, diamond cross, dashed ring). Failure is the only saturated color.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update CLAUDE.md**

In `CLAUDE.md`, replace

```
This is a Bun/Yarn workspace monorepo managed with Lerna + Nx, containing nine `@skandha/*`
packages under `packages/`.
```

with

```
This is a Bun/Yarn workspace monorepo managed with Lerna + Nx, containing nine `@skandha/*`
bundler packages and the `devnet-ui` web explorer under `packages/`.
```

and, in "Package layout", add this bullet after the `cli` bullet (the one ending `node (\`node\` + P2P) mode.`):

```
- **`devnet-ui`** — a static React app (Vite, Tailwind, TanStack Query/Router) that explores one or
  more Skandha instances through `skandha_explorer_*`: pool, activity, per-rule admission reports,
  peers. Not part of the `build` chain: it has its own `dev`/`test`/`build`/`test:e2e` scripts and its
  own toolchain versions (see its README). `bun run mock` there starts fake nodes for development.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Full verification**

```bash
cd packages/devnet-ui
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
bun run test:e2e
cd ../executor && bunx vitest run test/services test/modules test/config.test.ts
```

Expected: `typecheck` silent; `Tests  152 passed (152)`; the build ends `✓ built`; `11 passed` for the browser tests; the executor run `Test Files  22 passed (22)`, `Tests  212 passed (212)` (this branch adds nothing there, and it proves the new package did not disturb it). `git status` shows only the README and `CLAUDE.md` as changes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/devnet-ui/README.md CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs(devnet-ui): package README and CLAUDE.md notes

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage (sub-project 2).** Top bar with instance switcher, health and search: Task 10 (`InstanceRail`, `SearchBox`; health from polled `info`). Overview with a live mempool table and status filter: Task 10 (`PoolScreen`). Transaction detail with frames, rule-by-rule checklist grouped by frame and entity, lifecycle timeline, and the across-instances panel: Tasks 9 and 10. Activity including rejected ones with the failing rule: Task 10. Peers: Task 10. RPC layer with only the selected instance holding a WebSocket: Tasks 2, 3, 7. State (query cache keyed by instance, context persisted to `localStorage`): Tasks 4, 7. Protocol package with runtime validation and version banner: Tasks 1, 10. Routing `/tx/:hash?node=`, unknown node offers to add: Task 10. Error states: Tasks 2, 3, 10. Testing (Vitest for client, cache and rule grouping; Playwright against a fixture mock that is also the dev backend): Tasks 2 to 11. Build to a static bundle: Task 10. Deliberately not covered: serving under `/ui` from the API server, and deployment (see "Not in this plan").

**Deviations from the spec, all recorded.** No shadcn/ui and no viem (Task 1 amends the spec); code-based TanStack routes instead of file-based; query keys are `["x", url, ...]` rather than `[url, method, params]` (same prefix-invalidation property); hex quantities are decoded with `BigInt` instead of viem.

**Placeholder scan.** None: every code block is a verified file, every command has its expected output.

**Type consistency.** The names produced in each task's Interfaces block are the ones later tasks import; the per-task cumulative type-check and test counts were verified independently.
