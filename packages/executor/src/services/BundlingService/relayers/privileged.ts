/**
 * The only relaying strategy: this sidecar is not a general-purpose bundler
 * choosing among public/private relay pools - it's an outsourced mempool
 * client for one co-located, trusted ethrex node. It hands that node a
 * frame transaction it has already fully admission-checked itself via
 * `ethrex_submitPrivilegedFrameTransaction` - a demo-grade, unauthenticated
 * ethrex RPC method that forces the transaction into the very next payload
 * build, bypassing ethrex's own mempool admission pipeline entirely (no
 * fee-competitiveness check, no paymaster-reservation accounting, no
 * expiry-deadline check - see that method's own doc comment on the ethrex
 * side). It is NOT retried across blocks by ethrex: a submission not caught
 * by the very next payload build is simply gone, so a failed/missed attempt
 * here just leaves the mempool entry to be picked up and resubmitted on
 * `BundlingService`'s next pass, same as any other submission failure.
 *
 * Everything between "pick a wallet" and "broadcast" is gone: the
 * `encodeHandleOps` batch, the EIP-1559-vs-legacy / EIP-2930 access-list /
 * gas-limit / nonce construction of a fresh `TransactionRequest`, and the
 * `signTransaction` call that turned it into raw bytes. The bytes now arrive
 * already signed by the transaction's own sender, and re-signing them with a
 * bundler wallet is not something a relay is entitled to do. This strategy
 * needs no bundler key at all - `BaseRelayer`'s concurrency limiter is a
 * plain counter, not a wallet pool, for exactly this reason.
 *
 * This relayer's job ends once the submission RPC call returns a hash and
 * the entry is marked `Submitted` - it does NOT wait around to find out
 * whether the transaction actually landed. That used to be done here (a
 * polling loop that waited for a status nothing ever set, and consequently
 * always timed out and mismarked even successful submissions `Reverted` -
 * a real bug, not a design choice). Inclusion detection is now
 * `MempoolReconciler`'s job (`BundlingService/reconciliation.ts`), run once
 * per newly observed block against every `Submitted` entry via
 * `ReceiptService` - see that class's doc comment.
 *
 * `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` (with `{knownAccounts: storageMap}`) is
 * also dropped. Its preconditions came from a bundle's merged validation
 * storage map, and its purpose was to stop the bundler paying for a batch
 * whose assumptions had gone stale. There is no storage map for a single
 * relayed transaction and no bundler-paid gas to protect, so an
 * empty-`knownAccounts` conditional call would assert nothing.
 * `networkConfig.conditionalTransactions` no longer affects this strategy.

   * Lets a deliberately-delayed transaction sit `Submitted`-then-`New`
   * across several real `BundlingService` passes without ever landing, so
   * `MempoolReconciler`'s existing `maxSubmitAttempts` cancellation can be
   * exercised end to end against a real chain - not reachable any other
   * way, since ethrex's own queue has no retry/backoff concept to piggyback
   * on otherwise. Left set (not single-use): every retry of the same tx
   * must keep using the same target block, or an unmarked retry would get
   * included immediately and the test this exists for would never see
   * `Cancelled`. Never populated by production code - nothing calls
   * `setTargetBlock` except the `debug_bundler_*` admin surface
   * (`BundlingService.setPrivilegedRelayTargetBlock`), which is itself
   * gated to localhost/testingMode/admin-key callers.
